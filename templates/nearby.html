            <h3>Potra Kund</h3>
            <p>Many places in the city are famously known amongst devotees, while there are many which despite being highly eminent are less known. One such place is the Potra kund, which is also known as the Pavitra kund as it purifies the soul.
              It holds immense significance in the hearts of Lord Krishnaâ€™s Devotees. It is believed that Devki and Vasudev used to wash their baby clothes in this Kund.</p>

            <h3>Shri Krishna Janambhumi</h3>
            <p>This is one of the most important places because this is where Lord Shri Krishna manifested himself in the prison house of the cruel king Kansa and set free his father Vasudeva and his mother Devaki. His purpose was to destroy evil,
              protect the virtuous, and establish righteousness on a firm footing. Adjacent to the entrance of the prison cell, stands the temple where Astabhuja Maa Yogmaya manifested.</p>
